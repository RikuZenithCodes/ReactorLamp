# ReactorLamp
Welcome to Stark Industries. This Lamp is supposed to model a Iron man arc reactor with a mount for it. using potentiometer to control brightness, buttons to control colour and on/off. Including a lcd screen to show the reactor on and off plus brightness of the reactor. (I was very humbled when I tried the 3d modeling of the arc reactor turns out I suck at making anything in auto fusion)

Why? At first I wanted to make a iron man reactor that worked as a portable charger with extra add ons but with the amount of time I had left to finish off everything that was unrealistic and I was stepping into a field I had no idea how to do. So I decided to try and make a lamp so it was still something I liked.
