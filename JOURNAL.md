Since I have very limited knowledge of how to use Kicad and don't have footprints or the ability to wire at a high level I decided to use Tinkercad because I at least have a little bit of experience with it. The first day I used my time to decide what parts I want to use and what they should do. As you can see when I first wired this I had only one button and I figured that I should add another one to add more features to my lamp so I added another button. (I also cleaned up the wiring for it too because one of my friends told to me) Then I tried simply turning on my neopixel and it wasn't working so I spent the next hour thinking... Just for it to be I wired the capcaitor completely wrong. So I rewired it. I after the capcaitor incident I decided to give myself a nights sleep.

# July 22nd coding
I started the code which took longer then expected because my lcd screen was the wrong base which made it not even turn on. I was working with the neopxiel (havent worked with before) and forgot had to work with arduino so I had to relearn it all.

# July 23rd CAD
This was the most challenging part of this project as I have close to no experience with 3d modeling. And I had to do a lot of revisions becuase I don't know how to CAD so my inital vision gone...

# July 24th CAD
Today I start making the base of the Project where the reactor can sit. (I went through a lot of revisions... Just wait for the final product)

# July 25th CAD/Polish
Because time is getting tight and I have a lot of stuff going on I decided to stay up. After I got the final shape of the base done I started doing touch ups like texts into the base and such. I also added a brightness % depending on the potentiometer which took a little bit.
