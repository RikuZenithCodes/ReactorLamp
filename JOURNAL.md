Since I have very limited knowledge of how to use Kicad and don't have footprints or the ability to wire at a high level I decided to use Tinkercad because I at least have a little bit of experience with it. The first day I used my time to decide what parts I want to use and what they should do. As you can see when I first wired this I had only one button and I figured that I should add another one to add more features to my lamp so I added another button. (I also cleaned up the wiring for it too because one of my friends told to me) Then I tried simply turning on my neopixel and it wasn't working so I spent the next hour thinking... Just for it to be I wired the capcaitor completely wrong. So I rewired it. I after the capcaitor incident I decided to give myself a nights sleep.
